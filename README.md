# SangerAnalyst – A Free, Web-Based Sanger Sequencing Processor

SangerAnalyst provides a lightning-fast and straightforward way to process Sanger chromatograms within seconds—no installation required and 100% free.

The application performs automated quality trimming, forward–reverse read alignment, consensus generation guided by per-base Phred scores, and anchor-based primer trimming. It also produces a clear conflict report, making mismatches, gaps, and low-confidence positions immediately visible.

This streamlined workflow enables users to obtain an accurate consensus sequence while saving significant time and avoiding the usual manual analysis headaches.
